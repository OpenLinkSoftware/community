Solid Events are an opportunity for the Solid community to meet in personal locally. Solid Events are run by members of the Solid community like you. If you are thinking about running a Solid Event in your city here is some guidance from previous Solid Event Organisers.

# Solid Event Formats

## Entrepreneur-Investor Pitching 
One format is to invite local entrepreneurs and developers to pitch an idea for a Solid app or Pod Provider. You can also invite investors to pitch why their funds are appropriate for Solid values. 

## Hackthons 
Hackathons are great for passing on knowledge between those who are familiar with Solid to those who are learning. It is useful to have a concrete target for your hackathon that you can work towards together. There is a collection of eduational materials available at [Solid Teaching Materials](solid-resources.md). 

## Under the tree Solid philosophy
Sometimes it is useful to talk about the core values that define the Solid design. Value based conversations can be an excellent route to moving these conversations forward. It can be useful to define a theme or opening question. One way to focus the conversation is to set it up as a debate panel with multiple teams defending a specific perspective. Allocating people to defend perspectives they do not neccesarily agree with is a good way to open the mind and expand the debate. You can find slides and videos from previous talks on Solid in [Solid Resources](solid-resources.md)

# Logistics 

Partnering with existing meetups or organisations that regularly host events has the benefit of learning from their experience. Logistics can include anything from providing a space and equipment such as a projector or sound system. Partnering with experienced event organisers may also be useful in promoting the event itself. If the previous events are aligned with Solid perhaps their audiences would be interested in joining.
